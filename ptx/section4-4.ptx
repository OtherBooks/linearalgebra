    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> be two vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>.
        The <term>projection</term> of <m>u</m> onto <m>v</m> is a scalar multiple of the vector <m>v</m> given by the following formula.
        <me>
          \Proj_v u = \left( \frac{u \cdot v}{|v|^2} \right) v
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Note that the bracketed term involves the dot product and the norm,
    so it is a scalar.
    Therefore, the result is a multiple of the vector <m>v</m>.
    Projection is best visualized as the shadow of the vector <m>u</m> on the the vector <m>v</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> be two vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>.
        The part of <m>u</m> which is <term>perpendicular</term>
        to <m>v</m> is given by the following formula.
        <me>
          \Perp_v u = u - \Proj_v u
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We can rearrange the previous definition to solve for the original vector <m>u</m>.
    <me>
      u = \Proj_v u + \Perp_v u
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    For any vector <m>v</m>,
    every vector <m>u</m> can be decomposed into a sum of two unique vectors:
    one in the direction of <m>v</m> and one perpendicular to <m>v</m>.
    If <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are already perpendicular,
    then the projection term is the zero vector.
    If <m>u</m> is a multple of <m>v</m>,
    then the perpendicular term is the zero vector.
    We think of this decomposition as capturing two pieces of the vector <m>u</m>:
    the part that aligns with the direction of <m>v</m> and the part that has nothing to do with the direction of <m>v</m>.
    A vectors with its projection and perpendicular onto another vector is shows in <xref ref="Projections">Figure</xref>.
