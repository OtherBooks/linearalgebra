  <title>Properties of the Dot Product</title>
  <p>
    There are many pairs of orthogonal vectors.
    Thinking of the dot product as a multiplication,
    we have uncovered a serious difference between the dot product and conventional multiplication of numbers.
    If <m>a,b\in \RR</m> then <m>ab=0</m> implies that one of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> must be zero.
    For vectors,
    we can have <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> <m>= 0</m> even though neither factor in the product is the zero vector.
    We have a definition to keep track of this new property.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Assume <m>A</m> is a set with addition and some kind of multiplication and that <m>0 \in A</m>.
        If <m>u \neq 0</m> and <m>\neq 0</m> but <m>uv =0</m>,
        we say that <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are
        <term>zero divisors</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    An important property of ordinary numbers,
    as we just noted, is that there are no zero divisors.
    Other algebraic structures,
    such as vectors with the dot product,
    may have many zero divisors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that we have a new operation,
    it is useful to see how it interact with previously defined structure.
    The following list shows some interactions between addition,
    scalar multiplication, length and the dot product.
    Some of these are easy to establish from the definition and some take more work.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>u,v,w</m> be vectors in <m>\RR^n</m> and let <m>a</m> be a scalar in <m>\RR</m>.
        <men>
          \begin{array}{rll} u + v \amp  = v + u \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Commutative Law for Vector Addition }  \\ a (u+v) \amp  = au + av \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Distributive Law for Scalar Multiplication } \\ u \cdot v \amp  = v \cdot u \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Commutative Law for the Dot Product } \\ u \cdot u \amp  = |u|^2 \amp  \\ u \cdot (v+w) \amp  = u \cdot v + u \cdot w \amp  \hspace{1cm} \text{ Distributive Law for the Dot Product } \\ u \cdot (av) \amp  = (au) \cdot v = a (u \cdot v) \end{array}
        </men>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    In <m>\RR^2</m>,
    norms and dot products allow us to recreate some well-known geometric constructions.
    For example, now that we have lengths and angles,
    we can state the cosine law in terms of vectors.
    The visualization of the vector relationships of the cosine law is shown in <xref ref="The_Cosine_Law">Figure</xref>.

  <proposition>
    <title>The Cosine Law</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> be vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>.
        <me>
          |u-v|^2 = |u|^2 + |v|^2 - 2|u||v| \cos \theta = |u|^2 + |v|^2 - 2 u \cdot v
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
