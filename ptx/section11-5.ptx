  <title>Bases for Loci</title>

    If we have a solution space for a linear system expressed in free variables,
    we can write it as a vector sum using those free variables.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The following is an example of a solution space in <m>\RR^4</m>,
        with variables <m>w</m>, <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>,
        and <m>z</m>, where <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> are free variables.
        <me>
          \begin{pmatrix}w\\x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}1\\-4\\0\\0\end{pmatrix} + y \begin{pmatrix}1\\-2\\1\\0\end{pmatrix} + z \begin{pmatrix}-2\\-3\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an offset span.
        The span is all combinations of the vectors <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> and <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . Therefore,
        those two vectors are the basis for the span.
        An offset space itself doesn't have a basis,
        since basis is only defined for linear subspaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gives us a way to describe the basis for any locus:
        write it as a system,
        find the solution space by free parameter and idenfity the basis of the linear part.
