  <title>Perspectives and Philosophy</title>
  <p>
    In addition to the strictly mathematical material of the course, I will try to share some ideas which give perspective and context to mathematics.
    This include the philosophy of mathematics,
    the aesthetics of mathematics,
    and how our own worldview and assumptions influence mathematical thought.
    Linear algebra is perhaps the most abstract mathematical course offered at King's;
    at least, it offers the most oppotunity for abstract thinking.
    Therefore, I use this course as a venue for talking about abstraction in the context of perspectives and philosophy.
