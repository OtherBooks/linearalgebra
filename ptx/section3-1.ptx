    Earlier we said that we can't multiply two vectors together.
    That's mostly true,
    in the sense that there is no general product of two vectors <m>uv</m> which is still a vector.
    However, there are other kinds of <sq>multiplication</sq> which combine two vectors.
    The operation defined in this lecture multiplies two vectors,
    but the result is a scalar.

    <statement>

        The <term>dot product</term> or
        <term>inner product</term>
        or <term>scalar product</term>
        of two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is given by the following formula.
        <me>
          u \cdot v = \begin{pmatrix}u_1\\u_2\\\vdots\\u_n\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}v_1\\v_2\\\vdots\\v_n\end{pmatrix} = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + \ldots + u_n v_n
        </me>

    </statement>

    We can think of the dot product as a scalar measure of the similarity of direction between the two vectors.
    If the two vectors point in a similar direction,
    their dot product is large,
    but if they point in very different directions,
    their dot product is small.
    However, we already have a measure,
    at least in <m>\RR^2</m>, of this difference:
    the angle between two vectors.
    Thankfully, the two measures of difference agree and the dot product can be expressed in terms of angles.

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>angle</term> <m>\theta</m> between two non-zero vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is given by the equation
        <me>
          \cos \theta = \frac{u \cdot v}{|u||v|}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>

    This definition agrees with the angles in <m>\RR^2</m> and <m>\RR^3</m> which we can visualize.
    However, this serves as a new definition for angles between vectors in all <m>\RR^n</m> when <m>n \geq 4</m>.
    Since we can't visualize those spaces,
    we don't have a way of drawing angles and calculating them with conventional trigonometry.
    This definition allows us to extend angles in a completely algebraic way.
    Notes that <m>\theta \in [0, \pi]</m>,
    since we always take the smallest possible angle between two vectors.

      <p>
        Two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> are called
        <term>orthogonal</term> or
        <term>perpendicular</term>
        or <term>normal</term> if <m>u \cdot v = 0</m>.
