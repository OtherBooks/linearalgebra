  <title>Cross-Polytopes</title>
  <p>
    Another family of regular solids which extends to all dimensions is the cross-polytopes.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          In <m>\RR^2</m>,
          the cross-polytope is the diamond with vertices <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , and <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . In each dimension,
          two vertices are added at <m>\pm 1</m> in the new axis direction,
          and edges are added connecting the two new vertices to each existing vertex (but the two new vertices are not connected to each other)..
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In <m>\RR^3</m>, the cross-polytope is the octahedron,
          with vertices <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , and <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> .
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In higher dimensions,
          the vertices are all vectors with <m>\pm 1</m> in one component and zero in all other components.
          Each vertex is connected to all other vertices except its opposite.
