  <title>Dimension and Basis</title>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A set of vectors <m>\{v_1, v_2, \ldots,
        v_k\}</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is called
        <term>linearly independent</term> if the equation
        <me>
          a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + a_3 v_3 + \ldots + a_k v_k = 0
        </me>
        has only the trivial solution:
        for all <m>i</m>, <m>a_i = 0</m>.
        If a set of vectors isn't linearly independent,
        it is called <term>linearly dependant</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This may seem like a strange definition,
    but it algebraically captures the idea of independent directions.
    A set of vectors is linearly independent if all of them point in fundamentally different directions.
    We could also say that a set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector is in the span of the other vectors.
    No vector is a redundant piece of information;
    if we remove any vectors, the span of the set gets smaller.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order for a set like this to be linearly independent,
    we need <m>k \leq n</m>.
    <m>\RR^n</m> has only <m>n</m> independent directions,
    so it is impossible to have more than <m>n</m> linearly independent vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>L</m> be a linear subspace of <m>\RR^n</m>.
        Then <m>L</m> has <term>dimension k</term>
        if <m>L</m> can be written as the span of <m>k</m> linearly independent vectors.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be an affine subspace of <m>\RR^n</m> and write <m>A</m> as
        <m>A = u + L</m> for <m>L</m> a linear subspace and <m>u</m> a offset vector.
        Then <m>A</m> has <term>dimension k</term>
        if <m>L</m> has dimension <m>k</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This is the proper,
    complete definition of dimension for linear and affine spaces.
    It solves the problem of redundant information
    (either redundant equations for loci or redundant vectors for spans)
    by insisting on a linearly independent spanning set.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>L</m> be a linear subspace of <m>\RR^n</m>.
        A <term>basis</term> for <m>L</m> is a minimal spanning set;
        that is, a set of linearly independent vectors which span <m>L</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Since a span is the set of all linear combinations,
    we can think of a basis as as way of writing the vectors of <m>L</m>:
    every vector in <m>L</m> can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
    A basis gives a nice way to account for all the vectors in <m>L</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Linear subspaces have many
    (infinitely many)
    different bases.
    There are some standard choices.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>standard basis</term> of <m>\RR^2</m> is composed of the two unit vectors in the positive <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions.
        We can write any vector as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
        <men>
          e_1 = \begin{pmatrix}2\\1\\0\end{pmatrix} \hspace{2cm} e_2 = \begin{pmatrix}2\\0\\1\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}2\\x\\y\end{pmatrix} = x e_1 + y e_2
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <term>standard basis</term> of <m>\RR^3</m> is composed of the three unit vectors in the positive <m>x</m>,
        <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> directions.
        We can again write any vector as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
        <men>
          e_1 = \begin{pmatrix}3\\1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix} \hspace{1cm} e_2 = \begin{pmatrix}3\\0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix} \hspace{1cm} e_3 = \begin{pmatrix}3\\0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}3\\x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} = x e_1 + y e_2 + z e_3
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <term>standard basis</term> of <m>\RR^n</m> is composed of vectors
        <m>e_1, e_2, \ldots,
        e_n</m> where <m>e_i</m> has a <m>1</m> in the <m>i</m>th component and zeroes in all other components.
        <m>e_i</m> is the unit vector in the positive <m>i</m>th axis direction.
