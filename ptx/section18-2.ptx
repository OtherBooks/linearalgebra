  <title>Matrices of Determinant One</title>
  <p>
    Determinants measure two geometric properites:
    size and orientation.
    These are both symmetries.
    If we have matrices of determinant <m>\pm 1</m>,
    we know that they preserve size.
    If we have matrices of positive determinant,
    we know that they preserve orientation.
    If we have matrices of determinant one, they preserve both.

      <p>
        The group of matrices of determinant one with real coefficients is called the
        <term>Special Linear Group</term>
        and is written <m>SL_n(\RR)</m> or <m>SL(n)</m>.
