  <title>Composition</title>
  <p>
    Once we understood functions of real numbers,
    we learned to compose them.
    We do the same for linear transformations.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f : \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> and
        <m>g: \RR^m \rightarrow \RR^l</m> be linear transformations.
        Then <m>g \circ f : \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^l</m> is the linear transformation formed by first applying <m>f</m> and then <m>g</m>.
        Note that the <m>\RR^m</m> has to match:
        <m>f</m> outputs to <m>\RR^m</m>,
        which is the input for <m>g</m>.
        Also note that the notation is written right-to-left: In <m>g \circ f</m>,
        the transformation <m>f</m> happens first, followed by <m>g</m>.
        This new transformation is called the <term>composition</term>
        of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>.
