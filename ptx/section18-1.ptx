  <title>Symmetry, Again</title>
  <p>
    Throughout the course,
    we've talked about symmetry and defined types of transformation by their symmetries,
    that is, by what they preserve.
    We started the entire section of transformation with a symmetry property:
    linear transformations have the symmetry of preserving flat object
    (linear subspaces).
    We defined the dihedral groups as the linear transformation which preserved certain polygons.

    This persepctive is only strengthened as we get further into the discipline of linear algebra.
    Our classification of matrices,
    at least geometrically, is almost always a question of symmetry.
    In this section,
    we're going to define some new classes of matrices in terms of their symmetries.

    Recall the notation we're already established for matrix sets and groups
    (with real coefficients).
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set of <m>n \times m</m> matrices is written <m>M_{n,m}(\RR)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set of square (<m>n \times n</m>) matrices is written <m>M_n(\RR)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The group of invertible matrices is called the general linear group and written <m>GL_n(\RR)</m> or <m>GL(n)</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
