  <title>Transformation of Loci</title>
  <p>
    For loci, the picture is much more complicated.
    Equations do not transform nearly as pleasantly as spans.
    Planes in <m>\RR^3</m> are defined by a normal;
    we might hope that the new plane is defined by the image of the normal.
    Unfortunatly, since the matrix may not preserve orthogonality,
    this will usually not happen.
    To determine the image of a locus,
    the best solution is to describe the locus as a span or offset span find the image of the that span.
