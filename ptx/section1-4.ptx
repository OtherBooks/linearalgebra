  <title>Flatness</title>
  <p>
    While a geometry course,
    the geometry we are considering will be very restricted.
    The <sq>linear</sq> in linear algebra refers to lines,
    so we will start with the geometry of lines.
    However, the important property of a line,
    in our context, is the fact that it is straight: it doesn't curve.
    Linear algebra is the geomtery of flat things.

    Therefore, curved, bent and broken objects are off limits.
    We will investigate the geometry of flat objects:
    points, lines, planes and higher dimensional analogue.
    A great advantage of this restriction is the fact that flat things are very accessable.
    The geometry of curved objects is an immensely complicated and difficult subject.
    By restricting to flat objects,
    we can produce a wide range of accessible mathematical results.
