  <title>Symmetry</title>
  <p>
    Other than flatness, our other major geometric theme is symmetry.
    Many of the definitions and propositions produced in this course can be stated in terms of some kind of symmetry.
    Speaking broadly, I want to thing of symmetry as preservation:
    the symmetry of a shape is some kind of operation which keeps the shape intact,
    preserves it.
    Throughout linear algebra,
    we will be talking about the preservation of various kinds of shapes and flat objects.

    With the interplay between algebra and geometry mentioned above,
    we will also translate this idea of symmetry back to algebra to give a understanding of algebraic symmetry.
