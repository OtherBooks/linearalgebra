  <title>Local Direction Vectors</title>
  <p>
    We've already spoken about the distinction between elements of <m>\RR^n</m> as points and vectors.
    There is another important subtlety that shows up all throughout vector geometry.
    In addition to thinking of vectors as directions starting at the origin,
    we can think of them as directions starting anywhere in <m>\RR^n</m>.
    We call these local direction vectors.

    For example,
    as pictured in <xref ref="Local_Direction_Vectors">Figure</xref>,
    at the point <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> in <m>\RR^2</m>,
    we could think of the local directions <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> or <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . These are not directions starting from the origin,
    but starting from <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" />
    <em>as if that were the origin</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using vectors to define local directions is a particularly useful tool.
    A standard example is camera location in a three dimensional virtual environment.
    First, you need to know the location of the camera,
    which is an ordinary vector starting from the origin.
    Second, you need to know what direction the camera is pointing,
    which is a local direction vector which treats the camera location as the current origin.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the most difficult things about learning vector geometry is becoming accustomed to local direction vectors.
    We don't always carefully distinguish between vectors at the origin and local direction vectors;
    often, the difference is implied and it is up to the reader/student to figure out how the vectors are being used.
