  <title>Dot Products and Loci</title>
  <p>
    Having discussed spans, let's return to loci.
    By re-examing the linear equations,
    we can define loci via dot products.
    Consider, again, the general linear equation in <m>\RR^n</m>.
    <me>
      a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \ldots + a_n u_n = c
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's think of the variables <m>u_i</m> as the components of a vector <m>u \in \RR^n</m>.
    We also have <m>n</m> scalars <m>a_i</m> which we likewise treat as a components of the vector <m>a \in \RR^n</m>.
    The vector <m>u</m> is variables,
    the vector <m>a</m> is constant.
    Then we can re-write the linear equation using these two vectors.
    <me>
      a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \ldots + a_n u_n = \begin{pmatrix}4\\a_1\\a_2\\\vdots\\a_n\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}4\\u_1\\u_2\\\vdots\\u_n\end{pmatrix} = a \cdot u = c
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this way,
    a linear equation specifies that the dot product result of a variables vector <m>u</m> with a fixed vector <m>a</m> must have the result <m>c</m>.
    In this light,
    an affine plane in <m>\RR^3</m> is given by the equation <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . This plane is precisely all vectors whose dot product with the vector <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> is the fixed number <m>c</m>.
    If <m>c=0</m>,
    then we get <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . A linear plane is the set of all vectors which are perpendicular to a fixed vector <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> .
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>P</m> be a plane in <m>\RR^3</m> determined by the equation <img src="MISSINGFILE"  width="400" /> . The vector <img src="MISSINGFILE"  width="400" /> is called the
        <term>normal to the plane</term>.
        Let <m>H</m> be a hyperplane in <m>\RR^n</m> determined by the equivalent equation in <m>\RR^n</m>.
        <men>
          u \cdot a = \begin{pmatrix}4\\u_1\\u_2\\\vdots\\u_n\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}4\\a_1\\a_2\\\vdots\\a_n\end{pmatrix} = c
        </men>
      </p>
      <p>
        The vector <m>a</m> is called the
        <term>normal to the hyperplane</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    If <m>c=0</m>,
    the plane or hyperplane is perpendicular to its normal.
    This notion of orthogonality still works when <m>c \neq 0</m>.
    In this case, the normal is a <em>local</em>
    perpendicular direction from any point on the affine plane.
    Treating any such point as a local origin,
    the normal points in a direction perpendicular to all the
    <em>local direction</em>
    vectors which lie on the plane.
