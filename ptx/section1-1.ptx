  <title>Algebra</title>
  <p>
    Linear <em>algebra</em> is, as expected, an algebra course.
    (It is the only strictly algebra course taught at King's, though elsewhere,
    it would be the first of a sequence of algebra courses.)

    The word <sq>algebra</sq> does not mean the same thing in university mathematics as it did in high-school mathematics.
    Previously, the world <sq>algebra</sq> usually signaled the use of variables:
    <m>3+5 = 8</m> is arithmetic,
    but <m>3 + x = 8 \implies x = 5</m> is algebra.
    From that point, algebra became the manipulation of equations
    (and inequalities)
    with variables,
    particularly focusing on solving polynomials and rational functions.

    In academic mathematics, algebra has a much broader and deeper sense.
    It is a whole branch of mathematics, with many subdisciplines:
    linear algebra, abstract algebra, homological algebra, etc.
    One of the goals of this course will be to build as sense of what we mean by the term <sq>algebra</sq>.
    I'll give a definition right now,
    at the start, but it's a difficult definition to understand;
    hopefully the course will provide the necessary elaboration.

    <statement>
      <p>
        <term>Algebra</term> is the study of sets with structure.
        It investigates possible structures on sets,
        the rules obeyed by those structures,
        and the interaction of various structures.
