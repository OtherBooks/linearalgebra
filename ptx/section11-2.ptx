  <title>Dimensions of Spans</title>
  <p>
    We can now define the desired techniques to solve the dimension problems that we presented earlier.
    For loci and spans,
    we didn't have a way of determining what information was redundant.
    Row-reduction of matrices gives us the tool we need.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given some vectors <m>\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}</m>,
    what is the dimension of <m>\Span \{ v_1, v_2, \ldots,
    v_k\}</m>?
    By definition,
    it is the number of linearly independent vectors in the set.
    Now we can test for linearly independent vectors.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}</m> be a set of vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>.
        If we make these vectors the rows of a matrix <m>A</m>,
        then the rank of the matrix <m>A</m> is the number of linearly independent vectors in the set.
        Moreover, if we do the row reduction without exchanging rows
        (which is always possible),
        then the vectors which correspond to rows with leading ones in the reduced row-echelon form form a maximal linearly independent set,
        i.e., a basis.
        Any vector corresponding to a row without a leading one is a redundant vector in the span.
        The set is linearly independent if and only if the rank of <m>A</m> is <m>k</m>.
