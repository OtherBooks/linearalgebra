  <title>Abstraction</title>
  <p>
    The definition of algebra just stated is an immensely abstract definition.
    I haven't specified what sets or what structures I'm talking about. (I could say that we are looking at
    <em>algebraic structures</em>,
    but that doesn't actually add any insight;
    it just delays the question.) The definition is very broad,
    applies to a huge variety of sets and structures.
    Abstraction is built into the very nature of algebra.

    In the calculus courses, I often motivate the material by its applications.
    (The two most often used motivations are the Newtonian physics and percentage growth in ecology or finance.)
    In this sense, I'm treating the calculus as applied mathematics:
    mathematics driven by and designed for the solving of certain extra-mathematical problems.
    This is a reasonable approach for calculus,
    both for historical and pedagogical reasons.

    In this course,
    there will be points where I emphasize the practical applications of linear algebra,
    of which there are many.
    However, my primary motivation for the course will be intrinsic and abstract: I want to study sets and their structure simply for the mathematical joy of it.
    This is the one course at King's which is most suited to presenting the goals and ideas of abstract mathematics,
    in and of themselves.
