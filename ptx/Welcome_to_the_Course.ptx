  <title>Welcome to the Course</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      This courses uses a pedagogical model known either as blended learning or the flipped classroom.
      In this model,
      the majority of the content will be delivered outside of class time through two avenues:
      these notes and a series of short videos.
      You will be required to watch one of the short videos before most class periods.
      We will begin each lecture period assuming you have watched the required video.
    </p>
    <p>
      The videos are used to introduce the main ideas of the course.
      They are the explanation.
      Matched with each video will be a short section of notes.
      The notes are provided for reference,
      so that after you've watched the video,
      you can use the notes to remind yourself of the content and refer to useful ideas,
      concepts and formulae.
      The notes are not primarily written to explain the material;
      instead, they are written to provide a record of the ideas in the video for your reference.
      The notes are light on examples.
      The lecture time will be mostly devoted to necessary practice and examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course is organized into twenty-two lectures;
      the videos and the activities are numbered to match these lectures.
      There is a detailed schedule on the course website showing when the various lectures happen over the term.
      Please use this schedule to ensure you watch the appropriate videos before class and bring the appropriate sections of the notes.
