  <title>Points or Directions?</title>
  <p>
    We can think of a element of <m>\RR^2</m>,
    say <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , as both the point located at <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> and the vector drawn from the origin to the point <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , as shown in <xref ref="Points_and_Directions">Figure</xref>.
    Though these two ideas are distinct,
    we will frequently change perspective between them.
    Part of becoming proficient in vector geometry is becoming accustomed to the switch between the perspectives of points and directions.
