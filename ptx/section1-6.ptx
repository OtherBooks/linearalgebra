  <title>Proof</title>
  <p>
    Proofs are another major difference between the grade-school understanding of algebra and the academic sense of the word.
    Algebra is originally introduced to solve problems involving unknown quantities,
    usually by solving equations.
    Algebra is a problem-solving technique.
    In academic mathematics,
    we are usually more concerned with conjectures about mathematical objects and the proofs of those conjecture.
    In this course, we'll introduce the idea of conjectures,
    propositions, theorems and proofs.
    We'll do a small amount of proving on the assignments to build a flavour for proof-based mathematics.
