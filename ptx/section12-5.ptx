  <title>Symmetry</title>
  <p>
    Notice that we've defined linear functions by the objects and/or properties they preserve.
    This is a very general technique in mathematics.
    Very frequently, functions are classified by what they preserve.
    As discussed in the very first chapter,
    we use the word <sq>symmetry</sq> to describe this perspective:
    the symmetries of a function are the objects or algebraic properties preserved by the function.
    A function exhibits more symmetry if it preserves more objects or more properties.
    The conventional use of symmetry in English relates more to a shape than a function:
    what are the symmetries of a hexagon?
    We can connect the two ideas:
    asking for the symmetries of the hexagon can be thought of as asking for the transformations of <m>\RR^2</m> that preserve a hexagon.
    This is a bit of a reverse:
    the standard usage of the word talks about transformation as the symmetries of a shape.
    Here we start with a transformation and talk about the shape as a symmetry of the transformation:
    the hexagon is a symmetry of rotation by one sixth of a full turn.
