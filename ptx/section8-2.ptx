  <title>An Algorithm for Equations of Planes</title>
  <p>
    Now we can build a general process for finding the equation of a plane in <m>\RR^3</m>.
    Any time we have a point <m>p</m> on the plane and two
    <em>local direction vectors</em>
    <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> which remain on the plane,
    we can find a normal to the plane by taking <m>u \times v</m>.
    Then we can find the equation of the plane by taking the dot product
    <m>p \cdot (u \times v)</m> to find the constant <m>c</m>.
    <men>
      \begin{pmatrix}3\\x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix} \cdot (u \times v) = c
    </men>
  </p>
  <p>
    If we are given three points on a plane (<m>p</m>, <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>),
    then we can use <m>p</m> as the local origin and construct the local direction vectors as <m>q-p</m> and <m>r-p</m>.
    The normal is <m>(q-p) \times (r-p)</m>.
    In this way,
    we can construct the equation of a plane given three points or a single point and two local directions.
