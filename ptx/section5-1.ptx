  <title>Spheres</title>
  <p>
    Spheres are, in some way, the easiest objects to generalize.
    Spheres are all things in <m>\RR^n</m> which are exactly one unit of distance from the origin.
    The <sq>sphere</sq> in <m>\RR</m> is just the points <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>.
    The <sq>sphere</sq> in <m>\RR^2</m> is the circle <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>.
    The sphere in <m>\RR^3</m> is the conventional sphere,
    with equation <m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1</m>.
    The sphere in <m>\RR^4</m> has equation <m>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 = 1</m>.
    The sphere in <m>\RR^n</m> has equation <m>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \ldots + x_n^2 = 1</m>.
    For dimensional reasons,
    since spheres are usually considered hollow objects,
    the sphere in <m>\RR^n</m> is called the <m>(n-1)</m>-sphere.
    That means the circle is the 1-sphere and the conventional sphere is the 2-sphere.

    A sphere relate to the lower dimension spheres by looking at slices.
    Any slice of a sphere produces a circle.
    Likewise, any slice of a 3-sphere produces a 2-sphere.
