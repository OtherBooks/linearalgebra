  <title>Cubes</title>
  <p>
    Finally, we have the family of cubes.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <sq>cube</sq> n <m>\RR</m> is the interval <m>[0,1]</m>.
          It can be defined by the inequality
          <m>0 \leq x \leq 1</m> for <m>x \in \RR</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In <m>\RR^2</m>,
          the <sq>cube</sq> is the just the ordinary (solid) square.
          It is all vectors <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> such that
          <m>0 \leq x \leq 1</m> and <m>0 \leq y \leq 1</m>.
          The square can be formed by taking two intervals and connecting the matching vertices.
          It has four vertices and four edges.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In <m>\RR^3</m>, the square object is the (solid) cube.
          It is all vectors <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , such that each coordinate is in the interval <m>[0,1]</m>.
          It can also be seen as two squares with matching vertices connected.
          Two square gives eight vertices.
          Eight square edges plus four connecting edges gives the twelve edges of the cube.
          It also has six square faces.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Then we can simply keep extending.
          In <m>\RR^4</m>,
          the set of all vectors <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> where all coordinates are in the interal <m>[0,1]</m> is called the hypercube or 4-cube.
          It can be seen as two cubes with pairwise edges connected.
          The cubes each have eight vertices,
          so the 4-cubes has sixteen vertices.
          Each cube has 12 edges, and their are 8 new connecting edges,
          so the 4-cube has 32 edges.
          It has 24 faces and 8 cells.
          A cell (or 3-face) here is a three dimensional <sq>edge</sq> of a four
          (or higher)
          dimensional object.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          There is an <m>n</m>-cube in each <m>\RR^n</m>,
          consisting of all vectors where all components are in the interval <m>[0,1]</m>.
          Each can be constructed by joining two copies of a lower dimensional <m>(n-1)</m>-cube with edges between matching vertices.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
