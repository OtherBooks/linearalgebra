  <title>Calculating Inverse Matrices</title>
  <p>
    The definition is good,
    but we are left with the problem of determining which matrices have inverses and calculating those inverses.
    It turns out there is a convenient algorithm using techniques we already know.
    We write an extended matrix <m>(M|I_n)</m> with our original matrix and the identity next to each other,
    separated by a vertical line.
    Then we row reduce,
    treating the conglomeration as one matrix with long rows.
    If our row reduction of <m>M</m> results in the identity on the left,
    then the matrix has the form <m>(I|M^{-1})</m>;
    the right hand side will be the inverse.
  </p>
  <p>
    This algorithm gives us two observations.
    First, obviously, it is a way to calculate inverses.
    But it also is a condition:
    an <m>n \times n</m> matrix is invertible, in this algorithm,
    only if we get the identity matrix on the left after row reduction.
    This is part of a general result,
    which is the first of several conditions for intertible matrices.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <m>n \times n</m> matrix is invertible if and only if it row reduces to the identity matrix <m>I_n</m>.
        Since the identity has <m>n</m> leading ones,
        this is equivalent to the matrix having rank <m>n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The set of all intervible <m>n \times n</m> matrices with real coefficient forms a group.
        It is called the <term>General Linear Group</term>
        and written <m>GL_n(\RR)</m>.
        If we wanted to change the coefficients to another set of scalars <m>S</m>,
        we would write <m>GL_n(S)</m>.
        When the coefficients are understood,
        we sometime write <m>GL_n</m> or <m>GL(n)</m>.
