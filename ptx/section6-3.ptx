        If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets,
        their intersection <m>A \cap B</m> is the set of all points they have in common.
        The intersection of affine subspaces is also an affine subspace.
        If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are both linear,
        the intersection is also linear.

        Loci can easily be understood as intersections.
        Consider the locus of two equations,
        say the example we have from <m>\RR^2</m> before:
        the locus of <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=4</m>.
        We defined this directly as a single locus.
        However, we could just as easily think of this as the intersection of the two lines given by <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=4</m> seperately.
        In this way, it is the intersection of two loci.
        Similarly, all loci are the intersection of the planes or hyperplanes defined by each individual linear equation.
