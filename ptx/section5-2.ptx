  <title>Simplicies</title>
  <p>
    The simplex is the simplest straight-line polyhedra.
    I'll define them without specifying their vector definition in <m>\RR^n</m>,
    since that definition is slightly more technical than necessary.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The 1-simplex is a line segment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The 2-simplex is an equilateral triangle.
          It is formed from the 1-simplex by adding one new vertex and drawing edges to the existing vertex such that all edges have the same length.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The 3-simplex is a tetrahedron
          (or triangular pyramid).
          Again, it is formed by adding one new vertex in a new direction and drawing lines to all existing vertices such that all line
          (new and old)
          have the same length.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          This process extends into higher dimensions.
          In each stage a new vertex is added in the new direction and edges connect it to all previous vertices,
          such that all edges have the same length.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
