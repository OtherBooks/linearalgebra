  <title>Inverse Transforms</title>
  <p>
    When we defined Dihedral Groups,
    we already talked briefly about inverse linear transformation.
    Let's give a general definition.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>T: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^n</m>.
        The inverse transformation of <m>T</m> is a transformation
        <m>S: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^n</m> which undoes what <m>T</m> did.
        Equivalent, it is a transformation <m>S</m> such that the compositions
        <m>T \circ S</m> and <m>S \circ T</m> are the identity.
        For an arbitrary transformation,
        there is no guarantee that an inverse exists;
        if it does, it is written <m>T^{-1}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    This is the geometric definition.
    Now that we've encoded transformations as matrices,
    we can use matrices and ask for an algebriac definition of the inverse as well.
