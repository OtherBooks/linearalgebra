    In addition to presenting the second description of linear subspaces,
    this chapter also introduces linear combinations,
    span and linear (in)dependence.
    These are some of the most important and central definition in linear algebra.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>linear combination</term>
        of a set of vectors <m>\{v_1, v_2, \ldots,
        v_k\}</m> is a sum of the form
        <m>a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \ldots a_k v_k</m> where the <m>a_i \in \RR</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The <term>span</term> of a set of vectors
        <m>\{v_1, v_2, \ldots,
        v_k\}</m>, written <m>\Span \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\}</m>,
        is the set of <term>all</term> linear combinations of the vectors.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    After loci, spans are the second way of defining linear subspaces.
    Span are never affine:
    since linear combinations allow for all the coefficients <m>a_i</m> to be zero,
    spans always include the origin.
    To use spans to define affine subspaces,
    we have to add an offset vector.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        An <term>offset span</term> is an affine subspace formed by adding a fixed vector <m>u</m>,
        called the <term>offset vector</term>,
        to the span of some set of vectors.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Loci are built top-down,
    by starting with the ambient space and reducing the number of points by imposing restrictions in the form of linear equations.
    Their dimension, at least ideally,
    is the dimension of the ambient space minus the number of equations or restrictions.
    Spans, on the other hand, are built bottom-up.
    They start with a number of vectors and take all linear combinations:
    more starting vectors leads to more independent directions and a larger dimension.
  </p>
  <p>
    In particular, the span of one non-zero vector is the line
    (through the origin)
    consisting of all multiples of that vector.
    Similarly, we expect the span of two vectors to be a plane.
    However, here we have the same problem as we had with loci:
    we may have redundant information.
    For example, in <m>\RR^2</m>,
    we could consider the span <m>\Span</m><img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . We would hope the span of two vectors would be the entire plane,
    but this is just the line in the direction <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> . The vector <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , since it is already a multiple of <img src="MISSINGFILE" width="400" /> , is redundant.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem is magnified in higher dimensions.
    If we have the span of a large number of vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>,
    it is nearly impossible to tell,
    at a glance, whether any of the vectors are redundant.
    We would like to have tools to determine this redundancy.
    As with the tools for dimensions of loci,
    we have to wait until a later section of these notes.
