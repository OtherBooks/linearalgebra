  <title>Polyhedra in <m>\RR^n</m></title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now that we have defined vectors,
      we want to investigate more complicated objects in <m>\RR^n</m>.
      The major objects for the course work
      (linear and affine subspaces)
      will be defined in the coming lectures.
      In this lecture, however,
      we take a short detour to discover how familiar shapes and solids extend into higher dimensions.
      I'll use the standard term <em>polyhedron</em>
      (plural polyhedra)
      to refer to a straight-edged objects in any <m>\RR^n</m>.
      First, however, we start with a familiar without straight edges.
