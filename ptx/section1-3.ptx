  <title>Geometry</title>
  <p>
    Though the subjet is called <sq>algebra</sq>,
    linear algebra is a very geometric discpline.
    Given my background as a geometer,
    my approach to the course will be heavily geometric.
    We will start with vectors,
    which is a geometric discpline,
    though it has rich algebraic structre.
    Throughout the course,
    we will play the geometry and algebra against each other and use each to understand the other better.
    This interplay drives the discpline.
    In many ways,
    this will be a geomety course hiding under the title of an algebra course.

    In addition,
    we will not restrict ourselves for conventional two and three dimensional geometry.
    The definitions of this course are very general,
    so we will try to do geometry in any (finite) dimension.
    A major challenge of the course is going from familiar,
    visible three dimensions to un-visualizable higher dimensional geometry.
