    A regular polyhedron is one where all edges, faces, cells,
    n-cells are the same size/shape and,
    in addition, the angles between all the edges, faces, cells,
    n-cells are also the same whever the various objects meet.
    In addition,
    the polyhedron is called convex if all angles are greater that <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians.
    The study of convex regular polyhedra is an old and celebrated part of mathematics.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <m>\RR^2</m>,
    there are infinitely many convex regular polyhedra:
    the regular polygons with any number of sides.
    In <m>\RR^3</m>, in addition to the cube,
    tetrahedron and octahedron, there are only two others:
    the dodecahedron and the icosahedron.
    These were well known to the ancient Greeks and are called the
    <em>Platonic Solids</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The three families (cube,
    tetrahedron, cross-polytope) extend to all dimensions,
    but the dodecahedron and icoahedron are particular to <m>\RR^3</m>.
    It is a curious and fascinating question to ask what other special,
    unique convex regular polyhedra occur in higher dimesions.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <m>\RR^4</m>, there are three others.
    They are called the 24-cell, the 120-cell and 600-cell,
    named for the number of 3-dimensional cells they contain
    (the same way the 4-cubes contains 8 3-cubes).
    The 24-cell is built from 24 octahedral cells.
    The 120-cell is built from dodecahedral cells and the 600-cell is built from tetrahedral cells.
    The 120-cell, in some ways,
    extends the dodecahedron and the 600-cell extends the icosahedron.
    The 24-cell is unique to <m>\RR^4</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is an amazing theorem of modern mathematics that in dimensions higher than <m>4</m>,
    there are no regular polyhedra other than the three families.
    Neither the icosahedron nor the dodecahedron extend,
    and there are no other erratic special polyhedra found in any higher dimension.
