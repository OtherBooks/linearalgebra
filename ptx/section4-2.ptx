  <title>Angular Motion</title>
  <p>
    An important application of the cross product is found in describing rotational motion.
    Linear mechanics describes the motion of an object through space but rotational mechanics describes the rotation of an object independent of its movement through space.
    A force on an object can cause both kinds of movement,
    obviously.
    The following table summarizes the parallel questions of linear motion and rotational motion in <m>\RR^3</m>.

    How do we describe torque?
    If there is a linear force applied to an object which can only rotate around an axis,
    and if the linear force is applied at a distance <m>r</m> from the axis,
    we can think of the force <m>F</m> and the distance <m>r</m> as vectors.
    The torque is then <m>\tau = r \times F</m>.
    Notice that <m>|\tau| = |r||F| \sin \theta</m>,
    indicating that linear force perpendicular to the radius gives the greatest angular acceleration.
    That makes sense.
    If <m>F</m> and <m>r</m> share a direction,
    then we are pushing directly along the axis and no rotation can occur.

    The use of cross products in rotational dynamics is extended in many interesting ways.
    In fluid dynamics,
    local rotational products of the fluid result in turbulence,
    vortices and similar effects.
    Tornadoes and hurricanes are particularly extreme examples of vortices in the fluid which is our atmosphere.
    All the descriptions of the force and motion of these vortices involve cross products in the vectors describing the fluid.
